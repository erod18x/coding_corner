        "Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used for:\n",
        "\n",
        "<li> Web Development and Software Development\n",
        "    <li>Uber, Google, Facebook, Pinterst\n",
        "<li> Mathematics\n",
        "    <li>Data Science, Data Analysis, Computations\n",
        "<li> System Scripting\n",
        "    <li>Cyber Security, File Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "##What can Python do?\n",
        "<li> Used to create and host web applications.\n",
        "<li> Alongside other software to create workflows.\n",
        "<li> Connect to database systems. Can also read and modify files.\n",
        "<li> Handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
        "<li> Rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Why Python?\n",
        "<li> Works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
        "<li> Simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
        "<li> Allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
        "<li> Runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. Prototyping can be very quick.\n",
        "<li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Good to know\n",
        "<li>The most recent major version is Python 3, which we use. Many tutorials exist for Python 2, although it is not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular, we <b>DO NOT RECOMMEND</b> Python 2\n",
        "<li>In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.\n",
        "<li>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
        "<li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
